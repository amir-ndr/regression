A Stock Chart is a set of information on a particular company's stock that generally shows information about price changes, current trading price, historical highs and lows, dividends, trading volume, and other company financial information.
Open Price
The open price is simply the price at which the stock opened on any given day

Close Price
The close price is perhaps more significant than the open price for most stocks. The close is the price at which the stock stopped trading during normal trading hours (after-hours trading can impact the stock price as well). If a stock closes above the previous close, it is considered an upward movement for the stock. Vice versa, if a stock's close price is below the previous day's close, the stock is showing a downward movement.
